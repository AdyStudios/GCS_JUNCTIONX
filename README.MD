# TeleGO

### The Idea
We have chosen the *Crafthub Challange I*, and we have created an innovative solution for it. 
We think it is important to choose the right promotional tools for our target audience. Our application creates a solution to the challange, whilst it builds brand loyalty, and provides education, in a way that is appealing to young adults. We invented a platform for telecommunication services, which provides a multi-layer reward system. This platform is an opportunity for our users to educate themselfs in revelant topics, related to the cyber world. While they are learning, they can earn points, based on their knowledge, that they can exchange for bonuses, such as mobile data, whcih is a huge benefit for the younger generations. On top of this, we have developed a messaging app, that is entirely free to use, meaning no mobile data needed. This method of providing benefits to customers, insures a loyal customer-brand relationship.
